# liri-node-app

The app is taking a user input of a method and then a song or movie, and returning information on it using either the Spotify API or the OMD API. 

The app is run by entering in 'node liri.js [either movie-this or spotify-this-song] [a song or movie if the user wans to enter one]'. If the user chooses not to input a song or movie it will default to set values.
